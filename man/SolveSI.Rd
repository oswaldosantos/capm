\usage{
SolveSI(pars = NULL, init = NULL, time = NULL, dd = "b", im = 0,
  s.range = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pars}{\code{\link{vector}} of length 4. The values
  are point estimates of birth rate, death rate, carrying
  capacity and sterilization rate. The names of this values
  must be "b", "d", "k" and "s", respectively.}

  \item{init}{\code{\link{vector}} of length 2. The values
  are initial population size and initial proportion of
  sterilized animals. The names of this values must be "n"
  and "q", respectively.}

  \item{time}{time sequence for which output is wanted; the
  first value of times must be the initial time.}

  \item{dd}{string equal to \code{b} or \code{d} to define
  if density-dependece act on birth or death rartes
  respectively.}

  \item{im}{a number representing the total of immigrants
  per time unit.}

  \item{s.range}{optional sequence (between 0 and 1) of the
  sterilization rates to be simulated.}

  \item{...}{further arguments passed to
  \link[deSolve]{ode} function.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{list}}. The first element, \code{name}, is a
string with the name of the function, the second element,
\code{model}, is the model function. The third, fourth and
fifth elements are vectors (\code{pars}, \code{init},
\code{time}, respectively) containing the \code{pars},
\code{init} and \code{time} arguments of the function. The
sisxth element \code{results} is a \code{\link{data.frame}}
with up to as many rows as elements in time. First column
contains the time, second column the population size and
third column the proportion of sterilized animals. If
\code{s.range} is specified, fourth column contains its
specific instances.

\description{
System of ordinary differential equations to simulate the
effect of sterilization and immigration on population
dynamics.
}
\details{
The implemented model is described by Amaku, et. al., 2009
and the function is a wrapper around the defaults of
\link[deSolve]{ode} function, whose help page must be
consulted for details.
}
\note{
Logistic growth models are not intended for scenarios in
which population size is greater than carrying capacity and
growth rate is negative.
